#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me
<div style="font-size: calc(1em * 1.4) !important">
I'm PhD student at Leibniz University Hannover. I use empirical methods to study distortions emerging in the generation and evaluation of innovative ideas, with a focus on diversity and gender bias. I employ innovative experimental designs in large-scale experiments. <a href="/paper/">My research</a> offers guidance for organizations and policy makers on designing incentives and decision-making processes to foster innovation.</div>
